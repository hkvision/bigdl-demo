# Environment Preparation
- Create a conda environment and install the packages in requirements.txt. (pyarrow is used for saving to hdfs for spark backend)
- Pack the current conda environment: `conda pack -o environment.tar.gz` (Can uninstall bigdl-orca/bigdl-tf/bigdl-math/bigdl-dllib for the packaged conda env)
